{"image": "images\\Biology/51.png", "question": "Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited disease in the U.S. Among people of European descent, 4% are carriers of the recessive cystic fibrosis allele. The most common mutation in individuals with cystic fibrosis is a mutation in the CFTR protein that functions in the transport of chloride ions between certain cells and extracellular fluid. These chloride transport channels are defective or absent in the plasma membranes of people with the disorder. The result is abnormally high concentration of extracellular chloride that causes the mucus that coats certain cells to become thicker and stickier than normal. Mucus builds up in the pancreas, lungs, digestive tract, and other organs. This leads to multiple effects, including poor absorption of nutrients from the intestines, chronic bronchitis, and recurrent bacterial infections.Scientific work has been carried out to measure where the relative amounts of CFTR protein are localized in the affected cells\n\nAfter studying the graph, which of the following statements about CFTR protein is correct?\n\nA.

{"image": "images\\Biology/162.png", "question": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a common type of protein receptor containing seven transmembrane segments and bearing intracellular and extracellular portions. The structure of a typical GPCR and its associated partners is shown below. GPCRs are coupled to G-proteins consisting of three subunits (\u00ce\u00b1, \u00ce\u00b2, and \u00ce\u00b3) that bind the nucleotides GTP or GDP on the intracellular side of the GPCR. The presence or absence of a ligand on the extracellular side of the GPCR determines whether GDP or GTP will bind to the intracellular G-protein. Extracellular ligand binding initiates GDP being exchanged for GTP and the separation of the G-protein. One subunit will travel to join with a secondary partner and will initiate a cascade of signaling effects within the cell.

{"image": "images\\Biology_Free_Response/23.png", "question": "Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that produces a buildup of thick mucus in the lungs that leads to constricted airways, persistent coughing, and bacterial infections of the lungs. Also, mucus buildup from pancreatic cells blocks the secretion of pancreatic digestive enzymes and results in incomplete digestion and diarrhea. Life expectancy is 30 to 40 years for individuals who inherit two copies of the autosomal recessive trait.\n\nThe disorder is caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), an ATP-activated ion channel protein. Binding of ATP to CFTR triggers the opening of a channel that allows Cl- to passively flow across the plasma membrane. In epithelial lung cells, the channel enables the movement of Cl- out of the cell, though in other cell types, the channel can be structured so as to promote Cl- into the cell.\n\nIn normal individuals, epinephrine initiates a signal transduction pathway by binding to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) on the plasma membrane of epithelial lung cells. The GPCR then activates an exchange of a GTP for a GDP on a nearby G protein. This G protein, now activated with the GTP, binds to the GPCR. This allows the release of a G subunit (G\u03b1) that binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP activates a protein kinase (PKA). PKA enables two ATP molecules to bind to the CFTR protein, triggering the opening of a gated channel in the CFTR and allowing for the passive passage of Cl- out of the cell.\n\nThe movement of Cl- into the extracellular fluid creates an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane that induces water to move out of the cell. A Na+/K+ pump, also activated by PKA and ATP, helps regulate the electrochemical gradient to maintain an appropriate surface liquid on the epithelial cells.

{"image": "images\\Biology_Free_Response/25.png", "question": "Long periods of studying or other kinds of stressful mental activity cause the buildup of adenosine molecules in brain tissue. Adenosine is a ligand that binds to a G protein-coupled receptor on brain cells, activating a G protein by replacing its bound GDP with a GTP. A subunit of the G protein then binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase (AC), a membrane-bound effector protein. Adenylyl cyclase then catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger. The cellular response to cAMP varies widely in different types of cells. In brain cells and other cells of the central nervous system, cAMP activates a protein kinase (PKA), which slows brain activity and causes drowsiness. Normally, cAMP concentrations in the cell are kept low by the enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), converting cAMP to regular AMP (not cyclic). But high levels of cAMP can be attained during periods of mental fatigue or other kinds of stress.Does GTP bound to a subunit of the G protein activates adenylyl cyclase (AC)?

Position A is the active site. Position B is a region known to have a large number of nonpolar residues. Position C is known to have a large number of charged residues.\nA mutation is discovered in the gene for ARKKKK60491 that converts positively charged lysine residue into negatively charged glutamic acid residue. This single change directly impacts the location where the substrate to ARKKKK60491 attaches during catalysis. Which position is likely affected by this change? \nI. Position A\n\nII. Position B\n\nIII. Position C\n (Answer is a single letter.)", "answer": "I"}

{"image": "images\\Biology_Free_Response/33.png", "question": "An experiment is performed to evaluate the amount of DNA present during a complete cell cycle. All of the cells were synced prior to the start of the experiment. During the experiment, a fluorescent chemical was applied to cells, which would fluoresce only when bound to DNA. The results of the experiment are shown above. Differences in cell appearance by microscopy or changes in detected DNA were determined to be phases of the cell cycle and are labeled with the letters A-D.\nApproximately how long does S phase take to occur in these cells?

{"image": "images\\Biology_Free_Response/34.png", "question": "The cell cycle is a series of events in the life of a dividing eukaryotic cell. It consists of four stages: G1, S, G2, and M. The duration of the cell cycle varies from one species to another and from one cell type to another. The G1 phase varies the most. For example, embryonic cells can pass through the G1 phase so quickly that it hardly exists, whereas neurons are arrested in the cell cycle and do not divide. According to the figure, During which phase do chromosomes replicate?\nAccording to the figure provided, which is the LEAST possible location for Gerdellen to be placed?
